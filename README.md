# PCLA
PCLA (pronounced 'pick-lah') is a cross-platform raster image editor, based on JavaFX and Java 8.

It is designed as a replacement for Paint.NET, originally written because the
author was tired of Windows' poor behavior as a guest operating system under
Linux.

## Goals

 * Offer a UI similar to Paint.NET to make it easy to switch
 * Implement all the functionality offered by Paint.NET 4 and then some
 * Be sanic fast
 * Have a full plugin system, allowing the contribution of file types, effects, buttons, shapes, etc.

## Wishlist

 * Animation support (WebM/GIF)
 * *.pdn file import

## What does PCLA mean?
Nothing. No, really. I pressed four random keys and made up a bunch of acronyms.
It happened to have a picture-like pronunciation, which is one of the reasons I
chose it over some other acronym.
